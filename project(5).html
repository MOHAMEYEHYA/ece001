<h3>How do you benefit from artificial intelligence in developing the performance of your factory?</h3>
<p4>Artificial intelligence technology helps you make important, accurate and fast decisions and solve big problems such as those related to machine maintenance, process and product quality, maximizing operating efficiency and the consequent better investment of resources, reducing cost and improving productivity. The design, simulation, and artificial intelligence system can help you in plant design, machine plans, flow of materials and products, and product design, as well as the robot system plays a role in handling and transporting materials to and from the factory, as Well as performing roles that are dangerous to the human element or difficult, such as cleaning and maintaining machines and operating electrical circuits, and according to the Robotics Industry Association, robotics orders increased 5.2% during the third quarter of 2019 with 23,894 robotic units ordered, valued at $1.3 billion.Artificial intelligence plays a role in reducing dependence on labor and replacing them with smart machines that are more productive, efficient and less expensive, as well as ensuring the quality of processes and products through careful inspections of products and processes, and defect detection and treatment before approval. Artificial intelligence also plays a vital role in linking the factory to the distribution and supply channels for materials and services for its manufacturers, and this would enable the factory to plan production, meet consumer requirements, and reduce inventory and its cost. It also enables artificial intelligence to prepare and plan production reports and calculate the cost of products on a continuous,Accurate and fast basis without the intervention of labor, which saves time in preparing and distributing reports to officials in the factory and outside it, and improving the efficiency of factory management.Finally, artificial intelligence can increase factory productivity, improve the return on investment by Reaching the factory's maximum operating capacities, stimulate production, reduce waste and factory downtime for maintenance, and reduce the risk margin. Artificial intelligence also plays an important role in recognizing the operating powers of the machines and computers associated with them through the feature of recognizing a person's image, fingerprints, or tone of voice. A study conducted by McKinsey on a sample of US factories in 2018, confirmed that 44% of factories use robots in their operations,36% of factories use machine learning technology, and 37% of factories use visual security tools via electronic image recognition. These statistics emphasize the importance of artificial intelligence for factories, and illustrate the wide range of its uses, and the large number of factories to own smart machines to enhance their competitiveness and support their manufacturing operations.Artificial intelligence also plays an important role in recognizing the operating powers of the machines and computers associated with them through the feature of recognizing a person's image, fingerprints, or tone of voice.
