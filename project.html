<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry. </p>
<h3>HOW DOES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WORK?</h3>
Can machines think? â€” Alan Turing, 1950
Less than a decade after breaking the Nazi encryption machine Enigma and helping the Allied Forces win World War II, mathematician Alan Turing changed history a second time with a simple question: "Can machines think?" 
Turing's paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), and its subsequent Turing Test, established the fundamental goal and vision of artificial intelligence.   
At its core, AI is the branch of computer science that aims to answer Turing's question in the affirmative. It is the endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines.
The expansive goal of artificial intelligence has given rise to many questions and debates. So much so, that no singular definition of the field is universally accepted.  
The major limitation in defining AI as simply "building machines that are intelligent" is that it doesn't actually explain what artificial intelligence is? What makes a machine intelligent?
In their groundbreaking textbook Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, authors Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig approach the question by unifying their work around the theme of intelligent agents in machines. With this in mind, AI is "the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions." (Russel and Norvig viii)
Norvig and Russell go on to explore four different approaches that have historically defined the field of AI: 
Thinking humanly
Thinking rationally
Acting humanly 
Acting rationally
The first two ideas concern thought processes and reasoning, while the others deal with behavior. Norvig and Russell focus particularly on rational agents that act to achieve the best outcome, noting "all the skills needed for the Turing Test also allow an agent to act rationally." (Russel and Norvig 4).
Patrick Winston, the Ford professor of artificial intelligence and computer science at MIT, defines AI as  "algorithms enabled by constraints, exposed by representations that support models targeted at loops that tie thinking, perception and action together."
While these definitions may seem abstract to the average person, they help focus the field as an area of computer science and provide a blueprint for infusing machines and programs with machine learning and other subsets of artificial intelligence. 
While addressing a crowd at the Japan AI Experience in 2017,  DataRobot CEO Jeremy Achin began his speech by offering the following definition of how AI is used today:
"AI is a computer system able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence... Many of these artificial intelligence systems are powered by machine learning, some of them are powered by deep learning and some of them are powered by very boring things like rules."
<h3>HOW IS AI USED?</h3>
<p>Artificial intelligence generally falls under two broad categories: 
Narrow AI: Sometimes referred to as "Weak AI," this kind of artificial intelligence operates within a limited context and is a simulation of human intelligence. Narrow AI is often focused on performing a single task extremely well and while these machines may seem intelligent, they are operating under far more constraints and limitations than even the most basic human intelligence. 
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): AGI, sometimes referred to as "Strong AI," is the kind of artificial intelligence we see in the movies, like the robots from Westworld or Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation. AGI is a machine with general intelligence and, much like a human being, it can apply that intelligence to solve any problem. </p>

<h3>Machine Learning & Deep Learning </h3>

<p3>Much of Narrow AI is powered by breakthroughs in machine learning and deep learning. Understanding the difference between artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning can be confusing. Venture capitalist Frank Chen provides a good overview of how to distinguish between them, noting:  
"Artificial intelligence is a set of algorithms and intelligence to try to mimic human intelligence. Machine learning is one of them, and deep learning is one of those machine learning techniques." 
Simply put, machine learning feeds a computer data and uses statistical techniques to help it "learn" how to get progressively better at a task, without having been specifically programmed for that task, eliminating the need for millions of lines of written code. Machine learning consists of both supervised learning (using labeled data sets) and unsupervised learning (using unlabeled data sets).  
Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through a biologically-inspired neural network architecture. The neural networks contain a number of hidden layers through which the data is processed, allowing the machine to go "deep" in its learning, making connections and weighting input for the best results.</p3>
<h3>How do you benefit from artificial intelligence in developing the performance of your factory?</h3>
<p4>Artificial intelligence technology helps you make important, accurate and fast decisions and solve big problems such as those related to machine maintenance, process and product quality, maximizing operating efficiency and the consequent better investment of resources, reducing cost and improving productivity. The design, simulation, and artificial intelligence system can help you in plant design, machine plans, flow of materials and products, and product design, as well as the robot system plays a role in handling and transporting materials to and from the factory, as Well as performing roles that are dangerous to the human element or difficult, such as cleaning and maintaining machines and operating electrical circuits, and according to the Robotics Industry Association, robotics orders increased 5.2% during the third quarter of 2019 with 23,894 robotic units ordered, valued at $1.3 billion.Artificial intelligence plays a role in reducing dependence on labor and replacing them with smart machines that are more productive, efficient and less expensive, as well as ensuring the quality of processes and products through careful inspections of products and processes, and defect detection and treatment before approval. Artificial intelligence also plays a vital role in linking the factory to the distribution and supply channels for materials and services for its manufacturers, and this would enable the factory to plan production, meet consumer requirements, and reduce inventory and its cost. It also enables artificial intelligence to prepare and plan production reports and calculate the cost of products on a continuous,Accurate and fast basis without the intervention of labor, which saves time in preparing and distributing reports to officials in the factory and outside it, and improving the efficiency of factory management.Finally, artificial intelligence can increase factory productivity, improve the return on investment by Reaching the factory's maximum operating capacities, stimulate production, reduce waste and factory downtime for maintenance, and reduce the risk margin. Artificial intelligence also plays an important role in recognizing the operating powers of the machines and computers associated with them through the feature of recognizing a person's image, fingerprints, or tone of voice. A study conducted by McKinsey on a sample of US factories in 2018, confirmed that 44% of factories use robots in their operations,36% of factories use machine learning technology, and 37% of factories use visual security tools via electronic image recognition. These statistics emphasize the importance of artificial intelligence for factories, and illustrate the wide range of its uses, and the large number of factories to own smart machines to enhance their competitiveness and support their manufacturing operations.Artificial intelligence also plays an important role in recognizing the operating powers of the machines and computers associated with them through the feature of recognizing a person's image, fingerprints, or tone of voice.
